        "Python 3.7 has a built-in interctive debugger called **pdb**. It is possible to stop the execution of the code at any point by setting a breakpoint.  This will jump you into interactive the pdb command line.  From there you can then print values of variables, list lines of code, run one line of code at a time.  Taken directly from the [pdb documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html), here are the important five commands.\n",

        "With *pdb*m becaue you can step through on e line at a time, you don;t have to be as precise with the location of the breakpoint. So it is common to see a break point at the start of the misbehaving function.\n",
